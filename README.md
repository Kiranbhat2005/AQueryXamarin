AQuery (Android Query) Library for Xamarin Android
==================================================

####This is demo for Lazy loading of images in ListView using AQuery(Android Query) library.####

Android Query (https://code.google.com/p/android-query/) library provides various APIs to make async calls and manipulate UI in Android. Although there are various samples available in Android on its usage, there are not many example to use it in Xamarin.

The AQuery library(.jar) is converted to Xamarin using 'Java Binding Library' to dll and added to the project. You can download the dll from 'Libs' folder(AQueryXamarin / ListViewLazyLoadingImages / ListViewLazyLoadingImages / Libs). The sample application shows how to lazy load the images in the listview. The details regarding APIs can be found in the above mentioned URL.

NOTE: 1) Android Query is licensed under Apache 2.0 and since this is the C# version of the same library, the same licensing applies.
      2) More details regarding the sample application will be added soon.
